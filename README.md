# Task1-ServoControl
Arduino circuit design and programming to control 5 servo motors , using Potentiometer.


The Task is :
  #1- Arduino circuit design to control 5 servo motors
  #2- Then programming to inatial point (90 degree ) for all servo
  #3- Then the ability to control it (servo) via using Porentiometer. 
  
  
  so the circuit that i designed  
    # first after power up will go to inatial poitn (90 Degree) for all motor in the same time with 15ms delly 
    # after that we wilL have the possibility to control the servo by using Potentiometer for ech servo 
    
    
    
    have a good day :) My greetings
